🖊️ Handwritten Digit Recognition System
This project is a machine learning-based web application that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. It allows users to draw a digit or upload an image, and the system predicts the digit using a trained model. The website features an intuitive 3D-style UI, smooth animations, and an engaging user experience.

🔍 Features
🎨 Draw or upload handwritten digits for prediction

🔢 Perform arithmetic operations using digit images

🧠 Trained ML model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

🌐 Web interface built with HTML, CSS, JS, and Python (Flask)

📦 Centralized static files for clean structure

📊 Accuracy tested on the MNIST dataset

📁 Modular and well-organized project structure

📂 Technologies Used
Python, Flask

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV (for image preprocessing)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

MySQL (planned for future user data storage)

🚀 Future Enhancements
User dashboard with prediction history

Live training visualization

Support for multi-digit arithmetic
